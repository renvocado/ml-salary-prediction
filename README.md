## Project Portfolio Exploratory Data Analysis

### EDA is Exploratory and Explanatory Data Analysis. I'm using Global Super Store from Kaggle.com . Superstores industry comprises of companies that operateby having large size spaces which store and supply large amounts of goods. I'm using The dataset from this link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shekpaul/global-superstore

The superstore industry is comprised of extensive stores that sell a typical product line of grocery items and merchandise products, such as food, games, pharmaceuticals, apparel, toys, furniture, technology, and appliances.

The Analysis of such industry is of great importance as it gives insights for sales and profits of various products. My analysis is based on a superstore dataset in the world that ordered between 2015 and 2018.

Goals :

Region that accounts for greater number of orders
Frequency distribution of quantity ordered
Profitable category and sub-category
Percentage sales by category
Product type that was ordered greater times
Category and sub-category that incurred the losses
With this analysis the superstore can identify various aspects of the shopping patterns.

Insights:

From orders by Region : Center region has maximum order and canada has minimum order.
From Sales by Category: Technology has maximum contribution in selling activity
Treemap : Phone has highest sales under technology category and the lowest sales is labels under office supplies. from the color gradient, copiers and has highest profit and tables has lowest profit.
from pie chart, total sales by market : APAC has the highest sales followed by EU and the lowest is Canada.
By Bar chart, sales vs quantity : Standard class has more dominant in shipping mode. and the lowest is same day.
From sales vs discount : Discount mostly attract in standard class shipping mode
Provit vs sub-category and region : Copiers and phones mainly has heighest profit in central and north asia. Sales haven been made from the central region by category.
Shipping cost and profit are related, shipping cost and quantity are related.
Advices:

Technology, furniture, and office supplies that sell in central and north asia. must give a discount with different ratio followed with price of the goods.
Discount can give more attract in standard class shipp. mode, and another class shipp type can give discount with more consideration. Maybe quantity can combine with discount for good attention and evaluation.
Maybe in specific quantity can give free shipping cost or discount shipping cost based on quantity
For Tables, bookcases, and chairs under the furniture category must have more complex attention
